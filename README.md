# Sales-and-Finance-Analytics-for-AtliQ-Hardwares

In this project, I created a Sales Report using Excel pivot tables to help businesses optimize customer discounts, streamline negotiations, and identify high-potential markets. The reports offer actionable insights to enhance sales strategies, boost customer satisfaction, and increase revenue.

Throughout the project, I gained expertise in pivot tables, Power Query, and the fundamentals of DAX for advanced data analysis. I also improved data presentation through conditional formatting and refined the visual design of reports, making them intuitive and user-friendly.

By analyzing key sales metrics, this project equips businesses with the tools to make data-driven decisions, uncover growth opportunities, and improve overall sales performance. The insights provided enable businesses to refine their strategies for sustainable growth and market expansion.
